# vigilant-octo-engine #  Big Mart Data # EDA # Various Models # Gradient Boosting # RMSE

The goal of this project was to predict the item sales for Big Mart Sales data. 
Using this data set Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed along with building various models and comparing them.

Models built were:
- Gradient Boosting
- HistGradient Boosting
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees
- XGB
- K Neighbors 
- AdaBoost 
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Deep Learning Model

Metric used for model comparision: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

Results: Gradient Boosting performed best amongst all the models achieving 42% better performace compared to the worst model which was the deep learning model.
